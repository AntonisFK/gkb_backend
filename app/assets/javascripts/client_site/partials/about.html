    <h3>SPECIALITIES</h3>
​
    <p>We are a full-service, nonprofit, used bike shop specializing in rehabilitated preowned bicycles for sale. Revenue generated from our bicycle sales and repair goes to support our humanitarian and philanthropic programs: work training and college for former foster youth, and free bicycles and repair for those who cannot afford it.</p>
​
    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
​
    <p class="headline">Established in 2009</p>
​
    <p>Good Karma bikes started with a small group of friends and volunteers using old bike parts and personal tools to fix bikes at St. James Park. We graduated to a van and offered free repairs at churches, community centers, schools, and more. Realizing it wasn't enough just to fix the bicycles people had, in the fall of 2012, we moved into a space that would allow us to refurbish donated bikes and grant them to those who didn't have one.</p>
​
    <p>In 2015, we moved once more and now reside in a brand new arts and mercantile community building. Today, you can purchase a fully refurbished bicycle from our retail shop or visit our service department for repairs. For each bike sold, we provide one bike or repair for free to those in need. Former foster and disadvantaged youth work in our shop while enrolled in college as part of our College Opportunity Program.</p>
